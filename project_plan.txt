Plan for this project 

- First the user would ideally login (register & login) 
    - ideally I'd want to use the register & login lambdas from the fitness app (but who knows) 

- Home.html is where the user is logged in and submitting a journal entries and then when he submits tahts going to go into aws 
    - It'll either put the thing in s3 and then trigger some lambdas and sage maker processes to do some nlp stuff 

- src/ 
    - This is going to contain the Web UI (flask UI) - for journaling...
